Quick program to debug OpenEMU issue with two PS4 dualshock controllers

I bought two PS4 dualshock controllers to use with OpenEMU on my MacBook Pro. I wanted to play two-player NES and SNES games. Unfortunately, I encountered an issue where OpenEMU doesn't seem to properly distinguish between the two once a game is running (though you can seemingly configure Player 1 and Player 2 controls with no problem). So I wrote this program to see if it was a Mac issue or an OpenEMU issue.
